**Software Engineering Student**

**Ontario Tech University**

I enjoy learning new things and aim, to not only master my craft, but to broaden my knowledge as I dive in to the technological atmosphere.
I believe that if you understand how something is supposed to work, you can fix it. I strive to always learn new things and I am always ready to adapt.
I hope to become successful in my career and regarded as one who is good at what they do.
